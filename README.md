# Exploring the Benefits of OSF: A Guide to Collaborative Research and Data Storage

The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a fantastic tool for researchers and academics, and its features can really make your research life easier. Let's take a closer look at what OSF can do for you without all the fancy words:

## **1. Teamwork Made Simple**

OSF is like your research project's best friend. It helps you manage projects, whether they're big group efforts, research papers, lab notes, or templates for your buddies. It's a place to keep everything organized and everyone on the same page.

## **2. Safe Storage for Your Work**

Worried about where to stash all your research stuff? OSF's got you covered. You can store all kinds of things—data, documents, files—in the cloud. No need to fret about how many files or what types you can upload. Plus, OSF keeps track of versions, so you always know what's what.

## **3. Connecting with Other Tools**

OSF plays nice with other popular tools like GitHub, Box, and Google Drive. This means you can hook up your accounts with these services directly in OSF. No more hunting for scattered files and resources. OSF brings it all together in one place.

## **4. Boosting Visibility with DOIs**

Ever wanted more people to notice your research? OSF can help by giving your work Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). These nifty identifiers make your research easy to find and cite. It's like putting a spotlight on your work.

## **5. Sharing Easily**

When it's time to share your work, OSF's got your back. You can share stuff publicly or privately. If it's private, you can create view-only links—a secure way to show your work to others, like peers or for official reviews. Registrations are handy for archiving and showing when you did your work.

## **6. Find and Team Up**

Looking for other projects or fellow researchers? OSF makes it easy. You can search for projects from universities, datasets, research papers, and more. It's like a matchmaking service for researchers, helping you find the right people for your projects.

## **7. Track Your Impact**

Wondering if people are paying attention to your work? OSF's got analytics to help you see how your projects are doing. You can see how many people are looking at your stuff, downloading it, and sharing it.

In a nutshell, OSF is your handy tool for research and data management. You don't need to be a tech guru to use it. OSF can help you collaborate, store your work safely, and get your research noticed, all without breaking a sweat. It's like having a trusty research sidekick by your side.

Here is a more detailed explanation of how to get started with the Open Science Framework (OSF), including creating an account, starting a project, and storing your data.

1. Making an OSF Account:

To get started with OSF, you need to create an account. Follow these steps:
a. Visit the OSF website at https://osf.io/.
b. In the top right corner of the OSF homepage, you'll find the "Sign Up" button. Click on it.
c. You have two options for creating your OSF account:

Using ORCiD or Institutional Credentials: If you have an ORCiD account or are affiliated with one of OSF's Partner Institutions, you can click on the "ORCID" button. Follow the provided instructions to link your existing credentials to OSF.
Manual Account Creation: Alternatively, you can create an OSF account manually by entering your name, email address, and a password into the respective fields.
d. Before proceeding, it's important to read and review the "Terms Of Use" and "Privacy Policy." If you agree to these terms, check the box next to "I have read and agree."
e. To verify that you're a real user and not a bot, check the "I'm not a robot" box.
f. Finally, click the "Sign up" button to complete the account creation process.
After this step, you will receive a confirmation email from OSF at the email address you provided. To activate your OSF account, click the link provided in the confirmation email. Your OSF account is now officially created.

2. Starting a Project:

OSF provides a platform for managing and collaborating on research projects. Here's how you can start your own project:
a. Sign in to your newly created OSF account using your credentials.
b. Once you're logged in, you'll land on your dashboard. Look for the "Create new project" button and click it.
c. A modal titled "Create new project" will appear on your screen.
d. Enter a title for your project in the "Title" field. This title should succinctly describe your research project.
e. If you wish to add an institutional affiliation to your project, you can do so by selecting your institution from the available options. This step is optional.
f. Choose a storage location from the list of options. The default global location is usually pre-selected.
g. Optionally, you can provide a description of your project in the "Description" field. This description can help collaborators and others understand the purpose and scope of your project.
h. If you have an existing project structure you'd like to replicate, you can select a project from the menu. This will copy the project's structure without its content.
i. Click the "Create" button to initiate the project creation process.

Your new project will be created, and you'll be directed to the "Project Overview" page. This is where you can manage your project, including adding files, inviting collaborators, and organizing your research.

3. Data Storage on Projects:

After creating your project, you can use it as a central hub for storing and analyzing your research data. OSF projects offer a collaborative environment where you can work with team members on your research data. If you find that you need additional storage space for your projects, you can explore OSF Storage Add-Ons, which provide flexible storage options tailored to your research needs.

By following these detailed steps, you can successfully create an OSF account, start a project, and initiate a registration to transparently share your research journey with others. Be sure to refer to OSF's documentation and help sections for more in-depth guidance and specific features as needed.
