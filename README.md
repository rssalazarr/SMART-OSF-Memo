# Welcome to our OSF Wiki Memo!

We extend a warm welcome as you embark on the journey of setting up your account within the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform. This wiki memo is tailored to assist you, whether you are a novice user or simply seeking a quick refresher. Our aim is to make the account setup process seamless and straightforward.

### _Navigating This Guide:_

1.  **Getting Started:** Begin with a brief introduction to OSF and explore the advantages it offers for your academic research.

2.  **Account Creation:** Find detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create your OSF account. This section covers essential information, including user prerequisites, security recommendations, and various account types.

3.  **Commencing a Research Project:** Once your OSF account is successfully established, explore our instructions on navigating the OSF dashboard and initiating a new research project.

1. Making an OSF Account:

To get started with OSF, you need to create an account. Follow these steps:
a. Visit the OSF website at https://osf.io/.
b. In the top right corner of the OSF homepage, you'll find the "Sign Up" button. Click on it.
c. You have two options for creating your OSF account:

Using ORCiD or Institutional Credentials: If you have an ORCiD account or are affiliated with one of OSF's Partner Institutions, you can click on the "ORCID" button. Follow the provided instructions to link your existing credentials to OSF.
Manual Account Creation: Alternatively, you can create an OSF account manually by entering your name, email address, and a password into the respective fields.
d. Before proceeding, it's important to read and review the "Terms Of Use" and "Privacy Policy." If you agree to these terms, check the box next to "I have read and agree."
e. To verify that you're a real user and not a bot, check the "I'm not a robot" box.
f. Finally, click the "Sign up" button to complete the account creation process.
After this step, you will receive a confirmation email from OSF at the email address you provided. To activate your OSF account, click the link provided in the confirmation email. Your OSF account is now officially created.

2. Starting a Project:

OSF provides a platform for managing and collaborating on research projects. Here's how you can start your own project:
a. Sign in to your newly created OSF account using your credentials.
b. Once you're logged in, you'll land on your dashboard. Look for the "Create new project" button and click it.
c. A modal titled "Create new project" will appear on your screen.
d. Enter a title for your project in the "Title" field. This title should succinctly describe your research project.
e. If you wish to add an institutional affiliation to your project, you can do so by selecting your institution from the available options. This step is optional.
f. Choose a storage location from the list of options. The default global location is usually pre-selected.
g. Optionally, you can provide a description of your project in the "Description" field. This description can help collaborators and others understand the purpose and scope of your project.
h. If you have an existing project structure you'd like to replicate, you can select a project from the menu. This will copy the project's structure without its content.
i. Click the "Create" button to initiate the project creation process.

Your new project will be created, and you'll be directed to the "Project Overview" page. This is where you can manage your project, including adding files, inviting collaborators, and organizing your research.

3. Data Storage on Projects:

After creating your project, you can use it as a central hub for storing and analyzing your research data. OSF projects offer a collaborative environment where you can work with team members on your research data. If you find that you need additional storage space for your projects, you can explore OSF Storage Add-Ons, which provide flexible storage options tailored to your research needs.

By following these detailed steps, you can successfully create an OSF account, start a project, and initiate a registration to transparently share your research journey with others. Be sure to refer to OSF's documentation and help sections for more in-depth guidance and specific features as needed.
